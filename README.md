# 📖 [Hello-world] <a name="Hello-World"></a>


**[Hello-world]** is among the first project built by a developer who is in the early stages of learning how to code.
It demonstrates how to connect your local editor code remotely to your github repository.

Furthermore, In this project, you will learn to use linters to fix any error in your code.

## Linters

A linter is a tool that analyzes your source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs(source: [Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)>)).

There are a few reasons for using linters:

1. Catching syntax errors is more efficient. There is no need to debug simple mistakes like typos - the linter does it for you.
2. The entire codebase looks like written by one person.
3. Programmers can focus on solving problems, instead of cleaning up the code.

## Set-up linters in your local environment i.e on your editor

**Note**: The `npm` package manager is going to create a `node_modules` directory to install all of your dependencies. You shouldn't commit that directory. To avoid that, you can create a [`.gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file and add `node_modules` to it:

```
# .gitignore
node_modules/
```
